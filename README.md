## 1. How to Use the Plugin ðŸš€

This guide explains how to install and run your custom `MetalWeight` plugin.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

2.  **Locate the Plugin File:** After downloading the file, find the `MetalWeight.rhp`.
3.  **Install in Rhino/Matrix:** Open Rhino 5 or Matrix 9. Drag and drop the `MetalWeight.rhp` file directly onto the main window or open `plugin manager` and install the plugin.

## How to Use

1.  **Start the Command:** Type the command `MetalWeight` into the Rhino command line and press **Enter**.
2.  **Select Objects:** The command is designed to work with pre-selected objects.
    * If you select your 3D models *before* running the command, it will use them automatically.
    * If you have nothing selected, the command will prompt you to "Select solids or meshes".
3.  **Enter Density:** After the objects are selected, the command line will prompt you to enter the density (the "multiplication number") for your chosen metal. The default value is `17.0`. Type your desired number and press **Enter**.
4.  **View Results:** The plugin will calculate the total volume and estimated weight. The results will be printed to the Rhino command line history.

### Features

* **Validation System:** If the plugin detects any invalid, non-solid, or open objects, a warning message box will appear. It will list the number of problematic objects, select them in the viewport for you to inspect, and ask if you want to proceed with the calculation.
* **Performance:** The plugin is multi-threaded, so it can process a large number of objects very quickly on modern computers.
